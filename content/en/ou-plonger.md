The topography of the Port-Cros National Park is ideal for diving. The diversity of habitats offers a wide range of landscapes for divers of all levels, where they can explore typical Mediterranean ecosystems. As well as the coastlines of Port-Cros and Porquerolles and the most famous shipwrecks, the National Park offers access to lesser-known but equally attractive sites.

## Shipwrecks

The seabed around the islands of Porquerolles and Port-Cros bears traces of the past, dating from Antiquity to the 20th century.

Several wrecks of trading ships and isolated archaeological remains bear witness to the intense commercial activity that has existed between Mediterranean civilisations since ancient times. The most experienced divers can spend hours exploring.
