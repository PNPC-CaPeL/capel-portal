The first marine park in Europe, created in 1963, the Parc national de Port-Cros is an island, coastal and marine territory that stands out for the quality of its Mediterranean landscapes, both on land and at sea.

On the sea side, the national park covers 120,000 hectares (30% of which is classified as the heart of the national park), which are subject to strict regulations. Observation diving has become one of the attractions of the Port-Cros National Park, making it one of the top diving destinations in the Mediterranean.

In 1991, 11,700 dives were recorded on the island of Port-Cros during the summer season. At the time, 70% of dives were made at La Gabinière and the remaining 30% explored the Barge aux congres, Pointe du Vaisseau and Pointe de la Galère.

In the early 90s, when diving was in full swing, the National Park approached local diving organisations to work together to establish a framework for the activity in order to make users more aware of their responsibilities.

Resolution no. 14/92 of the Port-Cros National Park: the development of diving was noted, as was the risk of impacts on fauna and flora, and the desire to propose regulations to organise diving activities. Since 1992, an annual meeting has been dedicated to this management.

The first French diving charter was signed in 1994. Around twenty establishments voluntarily undertook to limit the number of divers on their sites and to ensure that their behaviour was respectful of the marine environment.
