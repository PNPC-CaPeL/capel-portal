## Are you receiving us loud and clear?

### 1/5 Setting sail 

I control my speed and slow down to less than 12 knots when within 600 metres of the coast, then to less than 5 knots when within 300 metres of the coast. I take great care to maintain a distance of more than 150 m from fishing indicators set by small-scale fishers, from divers, swimmers and light craft (kayaks, paddleboards, windsurfers, etc.).

### 2/5 In the core of the Park (less than 600 m from the coast)

### I check the on-board sailing instructions for regulations that apply in my location. I don't tow equipment, I keep the volume down if I'm listening to music, I don't set foot on meadows or in rocky shallows and I use the authorised channels when beaching. I don't enter areas where motorised vehicles are prohibited.
