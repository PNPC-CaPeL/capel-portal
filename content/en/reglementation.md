[The Bagaud Mooring and Light Equipment Area (ZMEL)](https://www.portcros-parcnational.fr/fr/des-decouvertes/sejourner/la-zmel-de-bagaud).

To avoid setting anchor on Posidonia meadows and coralline vegetation, use [the DONIA mobile.](https://donia.fr/)

## Are you receiving us loud and clear?

### 1/5 Setting sail 

I control my speed and slow down to less than 12 knots when within 600 metres of the coast, then to less than 5 knots when within 300 metres of the coast. I take great care to maintain a distance of more than 150 m from fishing indicators set by small-scale fishers, from divers, swimmers and light craft (kayaks, paddleboards, windsurfers, etc.).

### 2/5 In the core of the Park (less than 600 m from the coast)

### I check the on-board sailing instructions for regulations that apply in my location. I don't tow equipment, I keep the volume down if I'm listening to music, I don't set foot on meadows or in rocky shallows and I use the authorised channels when beaching. I don't enter areas where motorised vehicles are prohibited.

### 3/5 Taking a break

Before stopping, I check the sailing instructions to see if I can anchor or if I must moor at a specific facility (Bagaud Mooring and Light Equipment Zone). I always choose a sandy area to anchor so as not to damage the seabed. I don’t moor to “diving buoys” unless I am a scuba diver. I don't feed any animals (birds, fish, etc.). I don't throw away rubbish or waste water, I don't use toxic products to clean my boat, and I take care with the oil and fuel in my engine.

### 4/5 Fishing

Before setting off, I check the DIRM and DDTM websites or the Park offices for updated regulations. I respect the zones, opening dates, quantities and minimum sizes of species defined in the regulations. I do not target protected species (groupers, corbs, sea urchins from 15 April to 1 November, octopuses in summer, etc.), and immediately return any that I catch accidentally. I contact the staff in charge of environmental policing if I have any questions.
